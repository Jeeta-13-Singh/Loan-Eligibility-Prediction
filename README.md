# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
The Loan Eligibility Prediction project is a data analysis and machine learning initiative aimed at automating the decision-making process for loan approvals. This project leverages the power of two popular classification algorithms - Decision Tree and Naive Bayes - to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not based on a set of features and their accuracy in predictino the loan eligibility.
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate loan eligibility prediction system that can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions while minimizing the risk associated with loan approvals.
The Loan Eligibility Prediction project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques in automating and improving the loan approval process. By leveraging Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classification algorithms, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of loan eligibility predictions, ultimately benefiting both financial institutions and loan applicants.
